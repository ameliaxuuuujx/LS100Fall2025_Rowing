    "# Pose Landmarks with MediaPipe — From Local Videos & Folders Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is both a **guided lesson** and a **working pipeline** for detecting human pose landmarks from **local video files** or **entire folders** of videos using **MediaPipe Tasks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a clean Python 3.12 environment and verify required packages.\n",
    "2. Understand each step and terminologies.\n",
    "3. Download and select a Pose Landmarker model (**lite / full / heavy**) and understand accuracy–speed trade-offs.\n",
    "4. Read videos with OpenCV and run inference in **`RunningMode.VIDEO`** with correct **timestamps**.\n",
    "5. Export results as tidy CSVs for analysis: **2D image-normalized** and **3D world** landmarks.\n",
    "6. Create an **annotated MP4** showing the skeleton overlay.\n",
    "7. Build intuition for **visibility**, **image vs. world coordinates**, and simple feature engineering (e.g., joint angles).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Built for learning:** Along the way you’ll see short callouts explaining *why* each step exists (e.g., timestamps in VIDEO mode), how coordinate spaces differ, and how to tune speed vs. accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## After completing this guide, you will be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load one video—or loop through an entire folder—and extract the coordinates of the landmark bodypoints frame-by-frame.\n",
    "* Save two analysis-ready CSVs per video: one for **2D normalized** landmarks and one for **3D world** coordinates.\n",
    "* Produce an **annotated MP4** with landmarks and connections overlaid.\n",
    "* Explain and adjust **`RunningMode.VIDEO`**, **per-frame timestamps**, **visibility filtering**, **image vs. world coordinates**, and model variants (**lite/full/heavy**).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Python **3.12** virtual environment selected as the active Jupyter kernel. In case yo8u need help, please refer to the \"LS100_Guide 3_Introduction to Pose Estimation Using MediaPipe.pdf\" guide.\n",
    "> * Installed packages: `mediapipe opencv-python pandas numpy tqdm matplotlib seaborn`\n",
    "> * One or more local video files (e.g., `.mp4`) to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Ethics & consent**\n",

    "- **Timestamps matter:** in `VIDEO` mode you *must* pass `timestamp_ms` that increases with frames; we compute it from frame index and FPS.  \n",
    "- **Tracking saves compute:** in `VIDEO`/`LIVE_STREAM` the task performs pose tracking so the full model isn’t re-run every frame (helps latency).  \n",
    "- **Out-of-frame landmarks:** 2D normalized `x,y` can be outside `[0,1]` if a joint is off‑screen; use `visibility` to filter.  \n",
    "- **Model choice:** start with **full**, switch to **lite** for underpowered laptops or large batches, use **heavy** when you need the highest accuracy and can afford the speed.  \n",
    "- **Stride:** a cheap speedup is `frame_stride=2` (½ the frames) or higher.  \n",
    "- **Ethics & consent:** if students process videos of people, teach consent, privacy, and secure storage.\n"
